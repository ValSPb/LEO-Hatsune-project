    "### General comments and recommendations regarding coding style\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code conventions are summarized in [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#id26). Following these conventions greately improve code readability and simplify code writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In relation to your code, I'd like to emphaisize a few basic conventions:\n",
    "1. [Whitespace in Expressions and Statements](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements) - please read.\\\n",
    "   So, for example, \n",
    "   `par, cov = curve_fit(ff,dist_list,width_list,sigma=ey)` should be written as:\n",
    "   `par, cov = curve_fit(ff, dist_list, width_list, sigma=ey)`\\\n",
    "   If you start to follow this convention, after a while you'll notice that the code becomes easier to read and looking nicer; after a while this style will become your habbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Naming Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) - please read.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * \"Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Variable names follow the same convention as function names.\"\\\n",
    "   So, try to avoid using uppercase letters in variable (and function) names unless it is absolutely neccessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use meaningful names for variable and functions. Names like 'ey' and 'ff' are not good - at the moment you\n",
    "   can remember that `ey` means \"error y\" and `ff` - \"fit function\", but will you easily recall that in 1 year?\n",
    "   And what about other people who may read your notebook?\\\n",
    "   So, instead `ey` you might use, for example, `yerr` or `y_err` (quite common names for such quantity),\n",
    "   and instead of `def ff(...)` you might use `def parabola(...)`, since it is not just some function which will be used for fitting, but specific function - quadratic; later you might want to fit your data by other function (e.g. cubic) and define another function: `def cubic(...)`.\\\n",
    "   The same is true for function parameters: instead of naming them `a, b, c` you could have named them `a` (=\"amlitude\"), `xmin`, `ymin` or (`x0` and `y0`) (since `a > 0` in your case, `b` and `c` are minimum x and y respectively; this suggestion is not very important for such a simple function, though generally it is better to give meaningful names to function parameters if they have specific meanings. \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. It is a bad practice to encode variable type in its name, so instead of  `dist_list` and `width_list` \n",
    "   you might use something like `distance` and `peak_width`\n",
    "   (it is a matter of personal taste, but since nowdays we do not have strick restrictions on the length of variable name, I often prefer to use full word rather than abbreviation unless the word is too long\n",
    "    or has the commonly used abbreviation).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "As concerns the code itself:\n",
    "1. Try using NumPy arrays instead of lists for numbers. They are much more efficient and powerful than lists.\\\n",
    "   So, isntead of `ey = [4]*len(width_list)` it is much better to write `yerr = np.full(len(peak_width), 4.0)`\n",
    "   (I wrote `4.0` to make this array of type `float`, another way of doing this is \n",
    "   `yerr = np.full(len(peak_width), 4, dtype=float)`\n",
    "   (see [Array creation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.creation.html) for more on methods to create arrays). I'll give more examples below while commening on individual screenshots.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Do not use the `math` module if you are already using NumPy, i.e. instead of `math.sqrt(...)` use `np.sqrt(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Python 3's f-Strings instead of old-style formatting: %-formatting and str.format().\n",
    "   So, instead of `print(\"chi2 = {:7.3f}\".format(chi2)` it is better to write \n",
    "   `print(f'chi2 = {chi2:7.3f}')` - it is more consise and easire to read \n",
    "   (BTW, why do you want `7.3f`? If you want just three decimal digits `print(f'chi2 = {chi2:.3f}')`)\n",
    "   Actually, this can be written even shorter: `print(f'{chi2 = :.3f}')`\\\n",
    "   You can reed more about Python 3's f-Strings for exmaple [here](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)}"
